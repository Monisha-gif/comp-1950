# comp-1950
This is a new layout for comp1950 webpage on bcit website with a fresh take using latest advancements in web design

The colours used in the BCIT site are as follows:
#fff200: yellow
#003c71: blue (it is a background gradient, but this will do for now)
#2d2d2d: deep dark gray 
#fafafa: light gray in the background
#822c2c: maroon top banner
The font is Geogrotesque, but any sans-serif that looks like it will be okay.
The about us/about page will have a 3X2 grid structure, similar to the card layout in the bcit website. I hope that the HTML is set up okay for this. There are 6 sections: Format, Evaluation, Course Curriculum, Requirements, Course Policies, and Administrative Trivia that will go into these cards. 

The resources page will have one 3 col x 1 row grid for: Course Materials, Course Server, and Texts. 
Then it will have under this, one 2 col x 1 row grid for Instructor Assitance and Validators. 
The footer is the same on all pages, so is the nav and the header. 

Uploaded home, about us and resources html files (basic with lorem ipsum). Avreet, please check and apply CSS.

The lecture.html file is remaning. This is slightly different as will have Lecture 1 which will open on hover and show Lecture 1 (with lorem ipsum text) and then Lecture 2 which will also do the same. I will upload this one tomorrow morning by 11:00 am. Thank you.

Hello Avreet and Matin, 

I have added a basic lectures file. Please modify as needed. 

I have made a few small changes in index.html, which is the meta site. I have added the rationale for the CSS reset. I have changed see below to see above (since the site map is above the table of changes).  I have added one more improvement (JavaScript and jQuery. Matin, since you will be doing this, please write the rationale in the table, and please add a line or two to the Better UI, Navigation and Organization of Information part of the table as you have designed the site map. 

Summary of what is remaining:
1. Printer style sheet
2. Responsive design
3. CSS styles
4. Scripting
5. 404 page
6. Download lecture/print buttons
7. Some graphics work (BCIT logo, resizing of photos after CSS styles have been completed etc.)
8. Proofing for spelling mistakes

I can make the 404 page

Avreet, please let us know about CSS styles. I did not add a wrapper div for the entire contents of each page, but please feel free to modfiy the HTML as required.
