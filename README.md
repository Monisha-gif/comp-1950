# comp-1950
This is a new layout for comp1950 webpage on bcit website with a fresh take using latest advancements in web design

The colours used in the BCIT site are as follows:
#fff200: yellow
#003c71: blue (it is a background gradient, but this will do for now)
#2d2d2d: deep dark gray 
#fafafa: light gray in the background
#822c2c: maroon top banner
The font is Geogrotesque, but any sans-serif that looks like it will be okay.
The about us/about page will have a 3X2 grid structure, similar to the card layout in the bcit website. I hope that the HTML is set up okay for this. There are 6 sections: Format, Evaluation, Course Curriculum, Requirements, Course Policies, and Administrative Trivia that will go into these cards. 

The footer is the same, but please change to Home (instead of About). Thanks.
