			<h2> Rationale</h2>
			<p> These are the changes we incorporated into the <a href="#">prototype COMP 1950 site</a> and we recommend
				that the new build integrate all of these important features for the following reasons.</p>
			<table id="ratTable">
				<tr>
					<td> HTML5</td>
					<td> It is an upgrade from the existing XHTML 1.0 transitional doctype to the current standard which
						is widely supported in all modern browsers, and backwards compatible with most older browsers.
						This has allowed us to create semantic content that is search engine friendly. HTML5 is also
						compatible with a large <a href="https://mobilehtml5.org/" target="_blank">range</a> of mobile
						and hand-held devices. This is a significant enhancement as the data says that 50&#37; to
						70&#37; students rely on <a
							href="https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2018/07/more-students-rely-mobile-devices-complete-online-classes"
							target="_blank">mobile devices to complete their classes.</a></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Responsive Design and CSS3</td>
					<td> The new site is responsive. It adapts to the size of the user's viewport. It is more cost
						effective than creating a separate site for mobile users. A large percentage of Part Time
						Studies students at BCIT work and try to catch up on lecture notes and resources during their
						commute or breaks. Our clean and user-friendly responsive design makes it very easy for them to
						do this, and will make a big difference to the way students engage with the site. We have used
						CSS3 in the design of the site. It is supported by a wide range of browsers, and has many new
						design and layout modules like grid and flexbox that we have used. These work especially well
						with responsive design.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> CSS Reset</td>
					<td> The new site has a CSS Reset. This means that we can start with a blank slate by overriding
						default browser styles, giving us better control over the styles, so that they appear as
						consistently as possible across a wide range of browsers and devices that the COMP 1950 site
						will be accessed by. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> SEO Optimization</td>
					<td> We have used descriptive title tags and meta content throughout the site. This will lead to
						clear page descriptions in a search engine search result. We also plan to minify the code before
						uploading the site, to maximize page loading speed. This is an important factor for students who
						are on mobile data plans and access the site on their phones. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Sitemap in Footer</td>
					<td> The footer of each page on the new site has a sitemap. This not only helps search engines index
						the site, it also is a very useful navigation aid for students and users who reach the end of
						the page and want to go to other parts of the site</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Better UI, Navigation and Organization of Information </td>
					<td> We have redesigned the site architecture and navigation (please refer to the section above)
						<!--Matin will add-->. This makes the navigation and user interaction in the new pages more
						intuitive and user friendly. </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Lecture Notes in Print/PDF</td>
					<td> Despite the move to e-learning, many students want to have printed lecture notes that they can
						refer to and highlight. We have made it easy for them to do this with our Print Lecture buttons.
						These allow the student to save the file as PDF, or to print it, using the printer friendly
						stylesheet that we have used for the purpose. The styles make the lecture look like pages from a
						textbook.</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td> 404 Error Page</td>
					<td> We have created a custom <a href="nonexistent.html">404 (Page Not Found Error)</a> Page. In
						case a student or user clicks on a broken link or mistypes a url, they will be directed back to
						the site with this page. This is helpful to student engagement with the site, and helps prevent
						students logging out because they could not find their way back to the lectures or resources.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Better Design and Contrast</td>
					<td> We feel that the new pages offer better visual contrast, making it easier for users and
						students to read the content, especially on smaller screens. We have also tied in the general
						design and layout with the main BCIT website. We believe that this integrates the page with BCIT
						branding and gives it credibility as a learning platform.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Use of JavaScript and jQuery</td>
					<td>To make lectures even more organized, we used Javascript to hide and unhide each section based
						on the clicked title. As there were many tags involved to apply the visibility, we used jQuery
						for its much easier selector feature.</td>
				</tr>
